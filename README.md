# bilibili
Instruction:

The main folder for submission in our github is django_folder. We may use documents in other folders, which are indicated in our code.

Run our code:

1. Install gensim (no 3.3.0 version, which is problematic) and jieba.
2. Change directory to the first bilibili folder in django_folder.
3. Run  "python manage.py runserver" in shell
4. Go into http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
5. Then search!

Other sources that we have used:

1. For django implementation (including test2.html, views.py, cat_list.csv in res folder and main.css), we largely borrowed from ui file in pa3. We also consulted django tutorials on https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/ and https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK .
